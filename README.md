Uniformity - One Username, Many Networks
========================================

This concept is created to accomodate with people having same usernames spanned across several social networks. As displaying everything separately in every line is not that efficient, I decided to experiment with this thing and called it Uniformity â€” because, you know, it has same usernames.

Any feedback or things can be thrown to Issues in the repo, or if you want something to do with me, my email is at ohai@diagramatics.me.
